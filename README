==== cross-apple ====

This is an *almost* complete cross compiling Apple toolchain for 
Debian x86_64 in binary form.  
It supports ppc, i386 and x86_64 apple targets.

It is missing the official Apple SDKs since it's probably not legal
to redistribute them in this form.

However, if you are an "Apple developer" and have access to the SDKs
you can install this toolchain in one step by copying your SDKs 
into this directory and running the install script as root.

This is intended as a way for developers who are comfortable with linux
to cross-compile OSX compatible binaries without having to switch 
operating systems to do so.

You still need access to a Mac to test your binaries.

You need the official 10.5 SDK.

	Put 
		MacOSX10.5.pkg
			
	from one of the official Xcode dmgs into this directory then run:

	sudo ./install-cross-apple

:)

I have tested the cross compiler on a fairly simple case (i386) 
and it successfully compiles and links under linux, and executes on osx with 
i386 dynamic libs that were precompiled on a real mac for 10.6.

I have provided suitable scripts that switch your compiler environment between
default linux gcc and the cross-apple compiler, targeted at i386 builds.

To enable the cross compiler:
	
	. cross-apple-env

To reenable the default linux gcc:
	
	. normal-env


=== DISCLAIMER ===

	No Apple SDKs are provided in this repository.
